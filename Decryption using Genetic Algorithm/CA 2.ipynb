    "### 1. `prepare_dictionary()`\n",
    "In this method after removing all non-alphabetic characters and split them into words, a dictionary is used to store words by their length. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `generate_population()`\n",
    "It generate a random population of chromosomes with a given size. **Chromosome is a one-to-one maping between alphabetic characters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `fitting_fcn()`\n",
    "To implement a GA solution, it's necessary to evalute goodness of each chromosome. If we call decoded text as d and dictionary as dict,then fitting value of each chromosome is sum of length of each words in decoded text if it exists in dictionary. \n",
    "$$fitting\\_value \\triangleq \\sum\\limits_{word \\in d \\ \\& \\ dict } length(word)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. `crossover()`\n",
    "In this method, 2 given chromosomes(parent1 and parent2) are combined in order to create create 2 new chromosomes(child1 and child2). After generating a random index (r), [0-r) of parent1 and [r-26] of the parent2 make the child1 and [0-r) of parent2 and [r-26] of parent1 make the child2. There is a set which contains added characters in order to prevent repeated characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. `mutation()`\n",
    "Mutation swap 2 gene (character) values in a chromosome from its initial state. The purpose of mutation in GAs is to introduce diversity into the sampled population. **Mutation operators are used in an attempt to avoid local minima by preventing the population of chromosomes from becoming too similar to each other, thus slowing or even stopping convergence to the global optimum. Therefore using `corssover()` without `mutation()` is not enough to reach a global optimum especially when the first generation has a low population.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In other words, `crossover()` is an efficient method at the beginning because it combines chromosomes to find improve their fitting value, but at the final steps we may converge to a local optimum because of limited diversity of the initial population. `mutation()` plays the role key by changing the chromosomes randomly to prevent converging to the local optimum.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. `generate_next_generation()`\n",
    "After evaluting fitting value of each choromosome in last generation, they are selected pairwise in order to call `crossover()` and `fitting_fcn()`.\n",
    "The more fitting value a chromosome has, the more chance of selection it has. On the other words chanse of selection of a chromosome is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p \\triangleq \\frac{fitting\\_fcn(chromosome)}{\\sum\\limits_{C \\in all \\ chromosomes } fitting\\_fcn(C)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**This selection policy not only helps us to generate the next generation with the best chromosomes but also is a solution to reduce selection bias and similarity among chromosomes because of its randomness decision.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. `merge_two_generation()`\n",
    "Chromosomes with the most fitting value in the last generation and new generation will select for next iteration. **It's important to keep the size of each generation constant. Although growing a population increase variation, generating a new generation takes more time than before.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. `decode()`\n",
    "It's the main method of our genetic algorithm that generates a new generation in a loop until all words of the decoded string exist in the dictionary. At the end it prints the key and also returns the decoded string."
